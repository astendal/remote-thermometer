# IoT Thermometer
### Andrew Stendal

## Description
With the recent ubiquity of wireless internet, a new wave of devices joined the web. Dubbed the Internet of Things (IoT), 
web-capable appliances and a wide variety of home-control and monitoring equipment have become commonly available. The IoT Thermometer is another
addition to the latter group, taking real-time temperature measurements that can be viewed online and plotted in Google Sheets. This project 
uses the Photon, a compact microcontroller with onboard Wi-Fi manufactured by Particle. Particle's platform is heavily cloud-focused, with 
web utilities and standard libraries that allow remote control and monitoring of their devices. Temperature samples are taken with the 
DS18B20, a digital thermometer from Maxim Integrated that contains its own onboard ADC. The variant of the DS18B20 used in this project
is housed in a waterproof shell, allowing for a wider variety of applications. 

## Learning Objectives
The goal of this project twofold: to implement a useful utility in a new embedded systems environment, and to expand my limited understanding
of the technology behind the internet. This will require applying existing embedded systems knowledge to core IoT concepts such as cloud/device interfaces and web development.
